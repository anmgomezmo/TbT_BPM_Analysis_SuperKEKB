# Data analysis in Turn-by-Turn BPMs signals of SuperKEKB

Summary of main scripts and results of Master II thesis internship at Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire des Sciences du Num√©rique (LISN). For more details, consult the document [Memoire Master II](./Memoire_Master_II.pdf).

## Analysis 

Results of harmonic and optics analises are obtained employing SOMA package https://github.com/JacquelineKeintzel/SOMA.git. Experimental harmonic analysis shows some important resonances in the spectra of BPM signals, with focused in one around 0.38 in both the horizontal and vertical plane, which is explained by the Resonance Driving Term formalism as an octupolar field contribution along the ring (remarkable plots at [experimental plots](./output/output_experimental_data_HER_2024_06_17/plots/)). Tracking harmonic analysis do not present octupole resonances, but other resonances still under studing (plots at [simulation plots](./output/output_simulation_data_HER_2024_06_17/plots/)).      

### Experimental Data
Data taked for the High Energy Ring (HER) in June 17th 2024. Located at the [input](./input/input_experimental_data_HER_2024_06_17/) folder with the lattice file.  

### Simulation Data
Data generated by SAD software (see [tracking](./tracking/)), changing the action from 4.0 to 5.2, in intervals of 0.2, located at [input](./input/input_simulation_data_HER_2024_06_17/). Lattice file is the same employed in the experimentation.

## Scripts

- `Makefile:` To create required folders and files for SOMA, as run with a specific list of flags
- `bpm_data_comparer.py:` To read and convert .data and .sdds file between each of them
- `compare_spectra.py:` Read and creates plots of scaled spectras
- `convert_sdds_to_data.py:` To convert a list of .sdds files into .data files (requires bpm_data_comparer.py)
- `extract_bpm_names.py:` Extract the BPM names from several files and plots a colormap of BPMs kickout by in each stage SOMA
- `generate_file_dict.py:` Creates a dictionary file of .data and .sdds files, required by SOMA (used for the Makefile)
- `plotFrequ_Track.py:` To read .sdds simulation files with different action (zx_action.sdds name format), and plots the spectra
- `plot_rdt_compare.py:` Read files associated to a specific RDT and plot the comparison between them
- `plots.py:` Main script to read position, spectra and RDTs files, and plot any of them depending on the plane and a list of BPMs
