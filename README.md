# Data analysis in Turn-by-Turn BPMs signals of SuperKEKB

Summary of main scripts and results of Master II thesis internship at Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire des Sciences du Num√©rique (LISN). For more details, consult the document ./Memoire_Master_II.pdf .

## Analysis 

Results of harmonic and optics analises are obtained employing SOMA package https://github.com/JacquelineKeintzel/SOMA.git 

### Experimental Data
Data taked for the High Energy Ring (HER) in June 17th 2024. Located at the input folder with the lattice file.  

### Simulation Data
Data generated by SAD software, changing the action from 4.0 to 5.2. Lattice file is the same employed in the experimentation.

## Scripts

- `Makefile:` To create required folders and files for SOMA
- `bpm_data_comparer.py:` To read and convert .data and .sdds files between each of them
- `compare_spectra.py:` Read and creates plots of scaled spectras
- `convert_sdds_to_data.py:` To convert .sdds files to .data files (requires bpm_data_comparer.py)
- `extract_bpm_names.py:` Extract the BPM names from severeal files and plots a colormap of BPMs kickout by SOMA
- `generate_file_dict.py:` Creates a dictionary file of .data and .sdds files, required by SOMA (used for the Makefile)
- `plotFrequ_Track.py:` To read .sdds simulation files with different action, and plots the spectra
- `plot_rdt_compare.py:` Read files associated to a specific RDT and plot the comparison between them
- `plots.py:` Main script to read position, spectra and RDTs files, and plot any of them
